**Outline**

My goal is to create a themed boat ride in Unity.  I will create a basic storyline with a few scenes, with a  focus on the control logic of the ride vehicle and scene elements. The project will be built in Unity, and I will use a Khan Academy resource called Imagineering in a Box to help steer the creative and design aspects of this project.  Simulation of ‘big picture’ ideas is a fundamental element to the themed entertainment industry.  Exploration of the intersection between creativity and technology, building something fun that can be showcased, and learning new skillsets are the key objectives of completing this project.  

**Vision Statement**

Learning new skills is a skill in and of itself, and that is my primary motivation for completing this project.  Here are some of the foundational skillsets and knowledge that I expect to gain or expand upon with the completion of this project:

- Computer Science Fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, object oriented programming, software engineering - best practices.
- Unity: Learning new technologies. Exposure to and experience with a game engine. 
- C#: Learning new programming languages. 

**Motivation**

This project is important to me because it explores new technologies that are of personal interest to me, while helping to galvanize some of the fundamental knowledge that I have gained in my education thus far.  Most of our course projects have served a particular purpose and are accompanied by well structured outlines and specific requirements.  This course presents a unique opportunity to build our skillsets, with a project designed from scratch and tailored to our own interests.  

While technical, software engineering does require a creative mindset.  Problems that must be solved often are not often accompanied with an instruction manual.  This is an opportunity to explore that intersection.  I expect to take the job that I can get, within reason, upon graduation.  Ultimately, creative endeavors that require an expertise in software engineering is where I hope to find a career and this seems like an excellent way to express that interest.  

**Learning Objectives**

- Gain fundamental knowledge of a new programming language, C#: I expect to accomplish this with a variety of tutorials, both specific to the language itself and to how it is used within Unity.
- Galvanize computer science fundamentals: I expect to explore how the aforementioned fundamentals are ultimately utilized to complete this project.
- Enhance software engineering principles: Things like version control, testing, and proper naming conventions are important skills and habits to develop.  
- Portfolio Expansion: This project will highlight my ability to explore new technologies, and will add a personal touch to my project portfolio.


**Risks to Completion & Mitigation**

- Risk - New languages and technologies:
  - Mitigation - Complete tutorials for C# and Unity, before attempting to work through the project as outlined.
- Risk - Creative resources and intellectual property:
  - Mitigation - Focus primarily on the control logic of the ride and show elements.  Enhanced visual appeal can be an opportunity to expand upon this project at a later date.   
- Risk - Time constraints:
  - Mitigation - Outline key actionable tasks from week to week, leveraging blog and required piazza posts as scheduling tools (ie. Weekly ‘Next steps’ section).  Blog updates can also serve as documentation of work completed and key learnings. 

**Project Assessment**

- Document the progression of the project with blog post updates throughout the semester.  Blog posts should reference completion of specific goals that are outlined from week to week.  
- Git commits should tell a story and document the steps taken to complete the project. 
- Final ReadMe, completed at the end of the semester.  This should outline the core functionality of the project. 
- A working simulation that can be viewed as evidence of completion of this project.

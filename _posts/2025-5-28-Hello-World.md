title: Professional Development Week 1 - Getting Started
---
### Introduction

Hello!  I'm Travis and I'm glad that you are here.  This blog will primarily cover my work and progress for CSPB 3112 - Professional Development.  The Professional Development course provides students with a unique opportunity to explore new technologies, develop a portfolio site, and showcase the new skills gained during the semester with the completion of a project.  Weekly updates will cover new accomplishments, current challenges, and next steps as the semester progresses.   

### Getting Started

This week, familiarization with the course requirements was a primary focus.  To get started, I forked a repository to generate a simple Jekyll website hosted with GitHub pages and well...here we are.  Time was spent updating configuration files to personalize my website and learn the mechanisms to generate the first blog post.  I also decided on the high level details of the project that I will be working on this summer.  

I've always been interested in the intersection of creativity and technology.  An ideal career path would lead me to a software engineering position with Walt Disney Imagineering.  It's hard to say where life may take us but, given the open-ended nature of this course, I thought that this would be an excellent opportunity to explore technologies relative to themed entertainment.  I've decided to build a ride simulation in Unity for my semester project.  Some of the technologies and learning platforms that I'll be exploring are listed below:

1. Unity: This will be the game engine software that I will build the simulator in.
2. C#: This is the primary programming language used in Unity.
3. Imagineering In A Box: This is a free educational tool designed by imagineers, hosted with Khan Academy.

I'm sure that this list will expand along the way.  These topics should be a great place to start, as I look toward the completion of my project proposal.

### Next Steps

A project proposal will be the primary deliverable for next week.  Now that I've decided on a project to pursue for the semester, it is time to formalize a path forward.  The proposal will address motivations, goals, risks, and evaluation metrics that can be used to assess the completion of this project at the end of the semester.

Important Upcoming Dates:
* Project Proposal Due: June 5, 2025
* Personal Website Complete: June 17, 2025

**See you next week!**

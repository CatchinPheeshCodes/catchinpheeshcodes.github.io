title: Professional Development Week 3 - Getting Started With Unity
---
### Weekly Accomplishments
This week's primary accomplishments were becoming familiar with the basics of Unity and the creation of a boat path for my simulation.  I worked through some of the Unity Editor Essentials learning pathway in order to gain familiarity with the basic functions of the Unity editor.  With a shift in focus toward a tangible start to my project, I did not complete all of the learning objectives that I outlined last week.  Here are some of the tasks for my project that are now complete:

1. Boat design:  With the limited scope of this project, I do not have the time to experiment with the design and creation of 3D models.  I have chosen, instead, to utilize a boat design from [FAB](https://www.fab.com).  FAB is a new marketplace for digital content, by Epic Games.
2. Boat path: Using the Unity Spline package, I was able to design a boat path and orient the boat to travel along the spline.
3. Simulated Water: I downloaded a water shader for my project and gained familiarity with Unity's asset store in order to implement this feature.

Here is a brief demo of what I've done so far:

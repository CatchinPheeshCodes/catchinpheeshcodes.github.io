title: Professional Development Week 2 - Project Proposal
---
### Weekly Accomplishments

This week's primary accomplishment was to formalize the project proposal for this course.  My completed proposal can be found [here](https://catchinpheeshcodes.github.io/proposal/).  With the help of generative AI, I have broken my project out into 4 actionable phases, with estimated time commitments.  I plan to utilize resources like ChatGPT to help with the necessary Unity and C# learning materials that I will need to complete each phase of this project.  This is the basic outline for my project:

*Phase 1: Ride System. 15 - 20 hours*
- Set up waypoints defining the boat's path.
- Implement smooth boat movement from waypoint to waypoint.
- Rotate the boat to face the direction of travel.
- Build a simple ride state machine (Idle, Moving, Finished).
- Detect when the guest steps on the boat (trigger zone).
- Attach and position the camera to simulate the guest's perspective.

*Phase 2: Show Control. 10-12 hours*
- Add timed or triggered environmental effects (lighting changes, particle effects like fireflies or candles).
- Sync audio elements such as background music or sound effects with ride progress.
- Implement basic animation triggers (e.g., animatronic character movements).
- Enhance ride flow control (pause, resume, reset).

*Phase 3: Ineraction & Polishing. 8-10 hours*
- Add interactive elements (e.g., buttons or touch zones guests can use).
- Refine camera behavior (allow guest to look around or add subtle motion effects).
- Optimize performance and add polish (smooth transitions, UI elements like start/end messages).
- Add fallback or error states (handling if guest leaves mid-ride, ride restart options).

This may change throughout the semester, but I wanted a rough outline to stick to this semester.  

I also succesfully downloaded Unity and have started to skim through the [Unity Essentials Pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/unity-essentials) in order to learn how to explore the basic functions of the software.  

### This Week's Goals

Unity is rich with learning tools.  This week's goals will be to continue exploring unity via the essentials learning pathway and starter project, with a focus on the following modules:

1. Editor Essentials
2. 3D Essentials
3. Programming Essentials
4. Alternate C# learning resources, as needed.

I will also start to develop the ride system next week.  I plan to complete the following tasks:

1. Design the ride path.
2. Set up waypoints for boat travel.  The [Waypoints Tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/waypoints#) should be helpful.
3. Begin to implement boat motion from waypoint to waypoint.

If time allows, I will press on with the development of the ride system. 

### Impediments

With this project, I will be learning new technologies entirely from scratch.  A steep learning curve is certain to be the primary road-block that I encounter this semester.  My plan to mitigate this issue is to leverage tools like ChatGPT to find quality resources that I can leverage to gain the knowledge and experience needed to complete each task.

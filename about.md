Hi, I’m Travis Williams — a soon-to-be software engineer with a strong foundation in operations and supply chain and a growing passion for building creative, technology-driven experiences.

I bring over 10 years of experience in operations leadership, primarily in the organic food startup space, where I learned how to solve complex problems, lead cross-functional teams, and drive scalable growth. Now, I’m channeling those skills into a new chapter: I’m pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at CU Boulder, with plans to graduate in Fall 2025.

As I pivot into software engineering, I’m especially excited about opportunities that combine creativity, storytelling, and technology. I’m particularly drawn to themed entertainment and interactive experiences—fields like Walt Disney Imagineering that bring joy through innovation.

Beyond work and school, I’m an avid mountain adventurer, music lover, and proud dad. Whether I’m debugging a program or composing a new tune, I love projects that require both logic and imagination.

If you’re looking for someone who brings real-world leadership experience, technical skill, and a creative mindset to the table, I’d love to connect.
